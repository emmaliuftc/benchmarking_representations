Our analysis is organized as follows.

1. Single cell images
2. Preprocessing (result: pointclouds and SDFs)
   1. Punctate structures
      1. Alignment, masking, and registration
      2. Generate pointclouds
   2. Polymorphic structures: Generate SDFs
3. Model training (result: checkpoint)
4. Model inference (results: embeddings, model cost statistics)
5. Interpretability analysis (results: figures)

Continue below for guidance on using these models on your own data.
If you'd like to reproduce this analysis on our data, check out the following documentation.

- [Main usage documentation](./docs/USAGE.md) for reproducing the figures in the paper from published pointclouds and SDFs, including model training and inference (steps 3-5).
- [Preprocessing documentation](./docs/PREPROCESSING.md) for generating pointclouds and SDFs from from our input movies (step 2).
- [Development documentation](./docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for guidance working on the code in this repository.

# Quickstart

Use the cytodl api to run any given experiment. For e.g., train a rotation invariant point cloud autoencoder on the PCNA dataset

```bash
from cyto_dl.api import CytoDLModel
from pathlib import Path

model = CytoDLModel()
model.root= Path(os.getcwd())
model.load_default_experiment('pcna/pc_equiv', output_dir = './')

model.print_config()

model.train()
```
